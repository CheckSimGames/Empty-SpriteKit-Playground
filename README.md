# Empty-SpriteKit-Playground

An iOS SpriteKit game playground with the Apple boilerplate code removed so you can start prototyping your game idea.

When you create a SpriteKit game playground or project in Xcode, the template includes a "Hello World" label and code that displays spinning sprites when you tap the screen. You end up having to remove this code and the label to start making your game. This playground removes the code and label for you. 

## Showing the Live View

The playground's live view shows the game scene so it's important that the playground shows the live view. Without the live view visible, you can't play the game.

Above the editor where you type the source code is the jump bar. On the right side of the jump bar are two small buttons. Click the left button and make sure there's a checkmark next to Live View. If not, choose Live View.

Below the Live View menu item that appears when clicking the left button is a Layout item. Click that button to determine whether the live view appears next to the editor or below the editor.
